 The video discusses the reason why Toyota refuses to switch to EVs, with the title "Genius Reason Why Toyota Refuses to Switch To EVS!" and the duration of the video is 0:08:38. Toyota has refused to make the switch to EVs due to the inconsistency in the argument led by Tesla and other EV experts. They want to focus on other propulsion methods such as hydrogen hybrid and internal combustion engines or ice. The reason behind this decision is based on Toyota's understanding of the auto market and the fact that they have planned for the next 20-50 and 100 years, not the next five or ten. Toyota's strategy is to position itself as the go-to option for people who still want to feel the powerful Roar of a gas-powered engine and take a drive without having to worry about charging in range. They believe that EV adoption is not as rosy as we have been made to believe, and that Toyota has developed another type of fuel that could power vehicles and result in cleaner and more efficient cars. They have invested heavily in developing hybrid powertrains and have achieved significant success with them. Toyota may see hybrid technology as a more practical and proven option with existing manufacturing capabilities and infrastructure, and may choose to focus on improving and expanding its hybrid lineup rather than fully transitioning to EVS. Technical challenges, such as battery technology charging times and range limitations, are one of the reasons why Toyota has refused to make the complete switch to electric vehicles. Toyota struggled with its first and only all-electric vehicle, the BZ-4X, due to issues with Hub bolts on the wheels coming loose in the event of hard braking or a sharp turn. The company had to recall and stop the sale of this EV SUV in June 2022 due to Hub bolt issues, and it is possible that Toyota may be working to overcome these challenges or waiting for further advancements in technology for building EVS before committing to large-scale EV production. The reasons mentioned in this video are speculative and may not reflect the current or complete reasoning behind Toyota's decision-making process. Toyota is a large, arguably the largest automaker, and automaker strategies and decisions are influenced by a multitude of factors including market research, consumer preferences, technological advancements, regulatory policies, and economic consideration among others.
