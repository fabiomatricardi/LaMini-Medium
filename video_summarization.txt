 The video explains how to use LLaMa GPTQ 4-Bit Quantization to make millions of parameters smaller and smarter, and how it works. The video explains how to implement 4-bit quantization with GPTQ for LAMA. It explains the concept of quantization and how to change weights from 32-bit floating points to eight or four-bit integers using quantization techniques such as zero point quantization. The next concept is the derivative, which is used to update weights. It allows to minimize loss and minimize errors in the network. The article discusses how to update weights for 4-bit quantization using the Hessian concept and how to find emergent features. It also discusses the importance of dampening factors to avoid overfitting the network. The article then explains how to process weights and quantize them using zero point quantization. The goal is to minimize loss and error during the process. The article discusses how to compute total error using the inverse Hessian and how to balance out the error by adjusting the unquantized weights. It also mentions the need to use a Llama library to do GPTQ 4-bit quantization on a LLAMA model. The article concludes by stating that the process will take a significant amount of time and will take about 20 to 25 minutes.
