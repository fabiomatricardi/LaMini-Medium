 The Meta AI LIMA video is GroundBreaking!!! with a duration of 0:12:24. Facebook's AI paper called Lima is based on the Lama language model and is fine-tuned with a standard supervised loss to better align to the end tasks and user preference. The model is carefully curated and can perform complex queries without any reinforcement learning or human preference modeling. This is a significant part of the paper as a model's knowledge and capabilities are learned entirely. The paper discusses the importance of pre-training and alignment in language models, as well as the comparison of Lima's language model to GPT4 and Darwin's C 003. The paper also mentions the use of community question and answering Wiki data, push shift rated data set, and human evaluation and preference evaluation comparison. The results of the study are interesting and provide information about how to move past a crush and find healthy ways to cope. The paper discusses how Lima's response to a crush on a guy in a serious relationship can provide valuable information about how to break up and cope with feelings. It also highlights the mental effort involved in constructing such examples and how it can be difficult to scale up. Additionally, the paper highlights the potential of tackling the complex issue of alignment with a simple approach. The paper concludes that Lima less is more for alignment. The evidence presented in this paper shows the potential of tackling the complex issue of alignment with a simple approach. The paper suggests that Lima less is more for alignment compared to large data sets, fine tuning like alpacas, and enhancing the model with 52 000 instructions. Thank you for sharing this detail. I will link this paper in the YouTube description. I would love to hear your thoughts on this paper.
