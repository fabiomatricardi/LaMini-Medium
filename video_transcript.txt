----------------------------------------
demand for electric vehicles is clearly growing more Australians are buckling up in the race to go electric it's Toyota behind everyone else or is it smart to be cautious now thanks to advances in technology EVS are becoming popular in more affordable worldwide so you would expect Toyota to be at the Forefront leading the charge for an all-electric future for the Auto industry right not at all in fact the leadership of the Legacy car maker has stated numerous times that the company won't make the switch to EVS join us in this video where we uncover the real reason why Toyota has refused to make the all-important switch to EVs and why the reason is just brilliant but in order to understand Toyota's stance let's briefly catch you up to speed with why this is a big deal the EV Revolution was spearheaded by Tesla in the early 2010s and today we have lots of automakers dedicated to providing citizens of the world with a cleaner and better way of moving from one place to another apart from Tesla EV company such as rivien Lucid Motors byd and IO and many others are also taking up the charge Legacy car makers such as Ford Hyundai and Volkswagen have also invested billions of dollars into the process of building EVS for their customer base now looking at Toyota's Global sales numbers its top five markets are the US China Japan Canada and Australia all countries that have a high EV adoption rate and government transition incentives for making the switch the Japanese giant known for its hybrid cars has been slow to hop on the EV Trend and answer other companies feel is the way forward to tackle the climate problem instead they want to focus on other propulsion methods such as hydrogen hybrid and internal combustion engines or ice its former CEO who also happens to be the grandson of the company's founder Akio Toyota he had also voiced his opinions on the idea that EVS are the solution to the climate issues arising from using gas-powered vehicles and internal combustion engines Mr Toyota reiterated that his opinion is simply not true by pointing out the inconsistency in the argument led by Tesla and other EV experts after Akio Toyota step down from his position as CEO earlier in 2023 and former head of Lexis Koji Sato replaced him many people expected Toyota's position on the transition to EVS to change but Toyota shocked everyone again because Koji Sato reinstated the plan earlier stated by his predecessor that they have no plans of fully switching to EVS there's a reason why Toyota is the largest automaker because they planned for the next 20 50 and 100 years not the next five or ten the question that then follows is why what is Toyota's play here why has the auto giant refused to take the obvious route and join the EV Trend especially as it is seemingly the future of automobiles well the answer to these questions is multifaceted to start with the brilliant reason why Toyota has decided not to switch to EVS is born out of its understanding of the auto market Toyota knows that as long as there is freedom of choice there will be those who would not touch an EV with a 10-foot pole and would always go for an internal combustion engine-based gasoline vehicle this is why as Legacy automakers hopped on the EV Trend to take a loss on every EV sale they make Toyota will make a profit it is simply the truth about life we all cannot want the same thing and when it comes to Vehicles this concept remains valid so with this knowledge in mind it is clear that Toyota opt to position itself as the go-to option for people who still want to feel the powerful Roar of a gas-powered engine and take a drive without having to worry about charging in range basically Toyota's strategy is to please the widest possible range of customers with the widest possible range of power trades be it hybrids like the Prius hydrogen fuel cell vehicles or traditional internal combustion engine based gas-powered cars another reason why Toyota has refused to make the switch could be linked to the understanding of the reality of EV adoption in other words EV adoption is not as rosy as we have been made to believe there are many regions and parts of the world that have inadequate or zero infrastructure for robust EV adoption many countries in Africa and some parts of Asia have very little or no charging stations repair Maintenance and Service Centers for EVS as well as the relevant financial and credit facilities to facilitate the purchase of EVS without these important structures it is clear that these regions of the world would still rely on gas-powered vehicles for the nearest Future and Toyota seeks to remain their go-to option you may also want to consider this reason Toyota does not believe in electrification when it comes to cleaner energy sources instead the company has developed another type of fuel that could power vehicles and result in cleaner and more efficient cars this fuel type is hydrogen gas Toyota has been at the Forefront of championing the adoption of hydrogen fuel for cars the company went as far as building the world's first vehicle that runs on hydrogen gas the Toyota Mirai the Mirai is the best-selling hydrogen fuel cell car of all time since its launch in 2015 it has sold over 21 000 units that's how well the automaker believes in its idea of hydrogen fuel cells now it would be strange for a company that has set its sights on the development of hydrogen fuel to be overly involved in pushing for the adoption of yet another alternative fuel it would be like expecting Tesla to start making gas-powered Vehicles almost impossible right apart from leading the charge on the use of hydrogen fuel for cars Toyota is also focused on hybrid cars the company has been a Pioneer in hybrid technology with successful models like the Toyota Prius they have invested heavily in developing hybrid powertrains and have achieved significant success with them Toyota may see hybrid technology is a more practical and proven option with existing manufacturing capabilities and infrastructure and may choose to focus on improving and expanding its hybrid lineup rather than fully transitioning to EVS we can also make a case for technical challenges as one of the reasons why Toyota has refused to make the complete switch to EVS let's not forget that EVS come with their own set of technical challenges such as Battery Technology charging times and range limitations in fact we saw Toyota struggle with its first and only all-electric vehicle the bz-4x the bz series was Toyota's first entry into the pure EV market and while the crossover SUV had a Sleek design and a decent performance the company had to recall and stop the sale of this EV SUV in June 2022 due to issues with Hub bolts on the wheels coming loose in the event of hard braking or a sharp turn while this issue has been fixed and the sale of the EV has continued the company never really shook off this piece of bad PR that experience is not the kind of thing someone would expect from the largest car maker in the world with a reputation for building reliable low maintenance and high quality vehicles for over 80 years so it is possible that Toyota may be working to overcome these challenges or waiting for further advancements in technology for building EVS before committing to large-scale EV production they may also be concerned about potential issues related to the supply chain and availability of critical components like rare earth metals used in EV batteries it's important to note that many of the reasons mentioned in this video are speculative and may not reflect the current or complete reasoning behind Toyota's decision-making process Toyota is a large arguably the largest automaker and we know that automaker strategies and decisions are influenced by a multitude of factors including market research consumer preferences technological advancements regulatory policies and economic consideration among others
